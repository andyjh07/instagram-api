# instagram-api

This project is just a quick script I put together to utilise the Instagram API in PHP in a fairly simple way. It needs more work to store the token in a .env file (or similar) but it does the job it was built for at the minute. Once you get your Instagram API token, add it to an `instagram.dat` file in the root of your project, then take a loop at the example in `index.php`. There's also a method to renew the roken once the endpoit is hit, so setting a cron to access this endpoint every 28 days should keep your instagram feed alive.
